Firstly I started developing some BASH scripts in order to read logs from a linux server, this gave me a sneak peek of what Linux was cabable of and the power of doing things simpler aid by the command line. Later on those scripts had to be optimized and I did it by chaging them to PHP, in order to ad some postgresql queries and make it easier to add some HTML and CSS format inside email reports to be sent within everyday.</p>
<p>After that I started to take control and give support over the company\'s API. This was a very enriching experience, because thanks to this, the company was able to provide interconnection between the telephone operators to which we had connection and our customers, who needed that bridge between supplier and client.</p>
<p>Next, I helped in the development of a testing tool that helped the marketing team to schedule the tests the they should perform in different times at night, this gave them the posibility to make test even when they were no present, meanwhile they just had to review the email sent by the application. The application was written in Flask, the microframework for Python.</p>
<p>Lately, an team and I traveled over to Spain in order to receive training about a PHP framework developed by the team over there. This in order to give support to Colombian services and written in that framwrok, like that we should be able to take some workload from the spaniard team.</p>',

So I had to learn how to take wordpress dowloaded ZIP and upload it to the provided web hosting site. I had to learn somethings about themes, plugins, taxonomy, and another little about the layer under it which is just PHP.</p>
<p>Also I was required to integrate a web page that was ment to keep record of the points one seller had earned during the sells cycle, and present it to the the seller, so that he or she was able to redeem these point by some products that their employer would gave them, in order to encorage the sales. The integration should by made to Joomla, so I had to learn the basics of sign in and logout of it. The idea was that they should be able to login indistinctly in one page or another (ours or joomla), and be able to access their information without login twice in two different static.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was required to develop a financial management system, to be used inside the company. As there was a short budget for this project, I was only asked to develop a invoice creator and that based on that the person should be able to print it or send it.</p>',

It was almost like Wordpress, Drupal or Joomla, you need a database, a place to install the files, and you\'re done, after that, everything is configuration.</p>
<p>Later I was asked to create a template from the ground to a known content management system called Drupal, I made some two with different layout and that was the starting point for the web page of the company. That\'s how I learned a bit about creating templates for Drupal.</p>
<p>After that the company earned a contract in which we should provide the ways to automate the digitalization process of old documents, these documents were in very high in resolution, and needed to be first stored in a hierarchical way and in an specific place, to later be transformed into a PDF, trying to read the text inside it. The whole process was meant to be automatic, and that a user were able to insert metada into each document. The project was written in PHP aided by the CakePHP framework, that was my first time working with a software framework, and it was the introduction to this amazing world.</p>',
