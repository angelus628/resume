    'long-desc' => "My name is Luis Angel, and I’m a system engineer, graduated from EAN University, on November 2013. Since 2011 I’ve been a web developer for different companies and with different goals along my career.
    First in AdsMovil, it was web development oriented to mobile devices.
    When I was in OpenSky Consultores, I worked on a framework called Cake PHP, which gave me a lot to think about the tools already existing out there to make the programmer’s life a lot easier.
    Later, I helped develop accounting software for internal use in the company I was working in, it was hosted in a web server, and it was written in PHP.<br>
    Currently, I’m working on the development and support of the web service offered by Digital Virgo Americas, which allows the connectivity between the end user a the affiliate, in order to purchase a product or service through their mobile phone account.<br>
    Early on my career I had already decided what I wanted to be, and it was to be a developer, and when I learned HTML for the first time, I was amazed about the simplicity and speed of creating and putting things into a web page. I had to keep doing it and learn even more.<br>
    That's how I discovered the likes for development in general, but more for web development.<br>
    Later on I was introduced to C++ and it’s syntax, with classes, objects, inheritance, etc. that is how learned about object oriented development (OOP).<br>
After that I got into the PHP world, in that time, I used to think that C++ and PHP where very similar, maybe for that reason it was so easy for me to learn it and get the starting bases with it. After that I’ve just kept learning, and 5 year from then, I feel very comfortable with it.<br>
Of course I’ve learned some other programing languages during my experience, for example I came to meet JAVA when I was finishing University. I thought it was interesting but I found it very complicated, because you need many components in order to be able to deploy an JAVA application. Next, I discovered Python and Ruby, which are very between them, similar from my point of view, they both make easy to write elegant, organized code with less typing than PHP. I loved them both, and I’ve had the chance to work with Python, and it’s been a very eye opening opportunity. I worked on a project which was being build on Flask (A Python Microframework) and it was a great experience.",
